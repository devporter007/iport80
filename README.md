# iPort80
WIP emulator that tries to replicate Intel's 8085 microprocessor

I'm sticking with the original 8085A manual and will be implementing architecture and instructions as such.


## What works as of now?
* MOV, ADD, ADC, SUB
* ALU
* Memory

Currently, this emulator doesn't have a proper interface to interact with, so you have to tinker with things through the main function.

## Implementation Priorities(In Order)
* Complete instruction set of 8085
* An interface to interact with the emulator.
* and more,
